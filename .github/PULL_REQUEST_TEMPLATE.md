## If I'm adding a new SSB neon module to the list

From CONTRIBUTING.md:

- [ ] This module was built from the `neon new` CLI
- [ ] This module's JavaScript implementation is only very few lines of code
- [ ] This module's `vX.Y.Z-num` is backwards compatible with JS's `vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] This module's `vX.Y.Z-num` passes all tests from JS's `vX.Y.Z`'s test suite
- [ ] This module can be used as a drop-in replacement in at least one of these apps (tick which one(s)):
  - [ ] Patchwork
  - [ ] Patchbay
  - [ ] Oasis
  - [ ] Manyverse
- [ ] Using this module as a replacement requires changing only very few lines of code
